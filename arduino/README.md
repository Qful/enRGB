# SmartLight

SmartLight is an intelligent light which gives you various light capabilities, such as a night light or light shows.

The LED lights are controlled by an ESP8266-12F by Alexa via AWS IoT MQTT.  

There is also a PIR (passive infra-red) motion detecting sensor that may be turned on or off that can automatically turn on the lights when motion is detected.

The optional phone app may be installed by scanning the Blynk QR code (QR_Code_BlynkAppSmartlight.png) in the images directory.
